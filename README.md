# LeetCode Solutions in Python
This repository contains my solutions to LeetCode problems in Python. The solutions are organized by problem number, and each file contains a single solution.

To run a solution, you can simply open the file in a Python interpreter. For example, to run the solution to problem 1, you would open the 1-two-sum.py file and then run the following command in the interpreter:

python
python 1-two-sum.py

The solutions in this repository are not guaranteed to be the most efficient or correct solutions. They are simply my own solutions that I have written to help me learn and practice coding.

If you find any errors in the solutions, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
